Tonight
I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right

Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all trying to do
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe soul player
Uh look out
Pop pop it's show time

Guess who's back again
Oh they don't know?

Wearin' Cuban links

Don't look too hard, might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues
Ooh shit

I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket

So many pretty girls around me
And they waking up the rocket

Why you mad, fix ya face
Ain't my fault they all be jocking

Second verse for the hustlas, gangstas
Bad bitches and ya ugly ass friends
